content: Adversaries may modify systems in order to manipulate the data as it is accessed
  and displayed to an end user, thus threatening the integrity of the data.[1][2]By
  manipulating runtime data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process,
  organizational understanding, and decision making.Adversaries may alter application
  binaries used to display data in order to cause runtime manipulations. Adversaries
  may also conductChange Default File AssociationandMasqueradingto cause a similar
  effect. The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target
  application and process as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For
  complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access
  to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through
  a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.
